# CONTROLLER_DESIGN_FOR_LATEX_AXIS_FLIGHT
This is the file for project of ME 521 Linear control and design for MIMO system.

The project provided an linear aircraft model. The project was seperated into several tasks:

1. Examine the controllability and observability for the aircraft model;
2. Design full-state feedbck system to minimize the steady-state error;
3. Check the Singular values and decomposition (SVD) of the feedback gain;
4. Design observe for the system;
5. Evaluate performances of the feedback system, containing Command Following (CF), Disturbance Rejection (DR), Insensitivity to Noise (IN), and Robustness to parameter changes.
